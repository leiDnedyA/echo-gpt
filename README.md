# NLControl

An interface for executing various actions / automations using 
natural language from various sources. Current sources include:
1. CLI
2. Voice mode
3. Web client

My personal use case for this is using the web client to launch shows 
on my laptop from my phone, while the laptop is plugged into my TV via HDMI.

## Tools Roadmap
- [ ] Launch a show
- [ ] Track which episodes of a show you've watched in sqlite and launch the 
      next episode by default
- [ ] Be able to go to the next or previous episode when a show is already open
